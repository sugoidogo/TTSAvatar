## Voices
In local mode, availible voices will generally come from your operating system.
In StreamElements mode, a public endpoint of theirs is used to generate Amazon Polly voice audio.
At the time of writing, the list of supported voices is [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html).
**Only Standard voices are working at this time.**
Support for use of your own Amazon Polly instance is coming soon, which will allow you to use the neural voices.
